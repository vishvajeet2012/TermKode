# Security Policy

TermKode handles local source code, provider API keys, locally stored sessions,
and optional MCP tools. Please report suspected vulnerabilities
privately so users can be protected before details are published.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest published release and the current
`main` branch. Upgrade to the newest release before reporting a problem that may
already have been fixed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/vishvajeet2012/Termcode/security/advisories/new).
Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability.

Include, when applicable:

- The affected TermKode version, operating system, and installation method.
- A minimal reproduction or proof of concept.
- The expected and observed security boundaries.
- Potential impact, including whether credentials or local files are exposed.
- Any suggested mitigation, without including real secrets or user data.

The maintainers aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a status
update within seven days. Timelines for a fix and disclosure depend on severity
and release complexity.

## Scope

Reports involving path traversal, unsafe file access, credential disclosure,
installer integrity, dependency compromise, or MCP permission bypass are
especially valuable. Findings against
third-party services should be reported to the relevant provider unless TermKode
is the source of the vulnerability.

Please allow a reasonable remediation period before public disclosure.
